## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm an old school IT veteran working on updating my skills to more modern and well-known technologies. In my time, I've worked on application programming (in development enviroments most people have never heard of), and gradually moved to specializing in SQL Server DBA and back-end support. I'm hoping to continue with the back-end support as I enjoy the mental stimulation and puzzle-like solving to get things working together (even if they weren't supposed to be used that way!).
